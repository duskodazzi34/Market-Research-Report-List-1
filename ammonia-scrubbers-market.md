<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ammonia Scrubbers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Scrubbers</li><li>Wet Scrubbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ammonia scrubbers operate to remove ammonia from emissions, primarily in industrial settings. Dry scrubbers use solid sorbents to capture ammonia gases without the use of liquid, making them energy-efficient and producing minimal waste. In contrast, wet scrubbers employ a liquid solution to absorb ammonia, facilitating higher removal efficiency but generating wastewater. Both types serve crucial roles in controlling air quality and meeting environmental regulations, with dry scrubbers being more suitable for low moisture environments and wet scrubbers effective for high ammonia concentrations.</p></p>
